# Canvas LMS Simulated Dataset - Data Dictionary

*Comprehensive documentation for simulated educational analytics data designed for predictive modeling and intervention research*

---

## **Dataset Overview**

This collection represents a meticulously simulated Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) environment designed to mirror real-world educational patterns while protecting student privacy. The simulation encompasses a complete 16-week semester with 2,000 students across 8 diverse courses, generating over 200,000 interaction records that capture the complexity of modern higher education.

The dataset was created to address a critical gap in educational analytics research: the lack of accessible, granular student data due to privacy regulations. Every variable included is based on documented Canvas API capabilities and educational research, ensuring that insights derived from this simulation could be implemented in real institutional settings.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Realistic Behavioral Patterns**: Based on published research on student engagement and success factors
- **API Alignment**: Every feature maps to actual Canvas Analytics API endpoints
- **Educational Validity**: Incorporates evidence-based relationships between engagement, performance, and outcomes
- **Intervention Focus**: Designed specifically to support early warning systems and personalized recommendations
